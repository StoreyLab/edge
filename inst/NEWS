edge 0.99.z:

The edge package was first released in 2005 and described in the publication:

Jeffrey T. Leek, Eva Monsen, Alan R. Dabney, and John D. Storey. Edge:
extraction and analysis of differential gene expression. Bioinformatics,
22(4):507â€“508, 2006.
http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/4/507.abstract

It was an independently released R package by the John Storey Lab, which
included multi-threading and a graphical user interface.  However, edge has been
updated and will now be made available through Bioconductor; edge 0.99.z is the
development version of this Bioconductor package.
