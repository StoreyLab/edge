Description: The edge package is an integrated differential expression analysis
    package. Statistical testing using the optimal discovery procedure and 
    the likelihood ratio test are implemented in either static or time-course 
    experiments. Various implementations of other popular packages such as 
    snm, sva and qvalue are integrated in edge to provide a set of tools for 
    analysis.
