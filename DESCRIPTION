 Description: The edge package implements methods for carrying out differential 
     expression analyses of genome-wide gene expression studies. Significance 
     testing using the optimal discovery procedure and generalized likelihood 
     ratio tests (equivalent to F-tests and t-tests) are implemented for general study 
     designs. Special functions are available to facilitate the analysis of 
     common study designs, including time course experiments. Other packages 
     such as snm, sva, and qvalue are integrated in edge to provide a wide range 
     of tools for gene expression analysis.
