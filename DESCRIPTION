Title: Extraction and Analysis of Differential Gene Expression
Version: 0.99.0
Author: John D. Storey <jstorey@princeton.edu> with contributions from Jeffrey 
        Leek (>= 0.0), Sangsoon Woo (>= 2.0), Alan Dabney (< 2.0), and Eva 
        Monsen (< 2.0).
Description: The edge package is an integrated differential expression analysis 
             package. The differential expression analysis can be 
             adjusted by surrogate variables to account for potential 
             confounding effects. Both static and timecourse differential 
             expression analysis using the optimal discovery procedure are 
             supported.
