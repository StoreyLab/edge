Description: The edge package implements methods for carrying out differential
    expression analyses of genome-wide gene expression studies. Significance
    testing using the optimal discovery procedure and generalized likelihood
    ratio tests (equivalent to F-tests and t-tests) are implemented for general study
    designs. Special functions are available to facilitate the analysis of
    common study designs, including time course experiments. Other packages
    such as snm, sva, and qvalue are integrated in edge to provide a wide range
    of tools for gene expression analysis.
